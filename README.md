# The-Magic-Hat

<h2>Overview</h2>

You play as a wizard named Boshi who wakes up one day to find that his magical hat has been stolen! You set out on a perilous journey to find the culprit and take back your hat. Will it be the slimes of the overworld? or the goblins of the depths? or maybe.... the 'hat stealing' dragon!

<h2>Controls</h2>
